An example of experimental analysis for Floyd-Warshall
This algorithm has O(n^3) running time, that only depends on the dimension of the matrix and
otherwise does not depend on that matrix.

For some algorithms, the worst-case running time may manifest itself
only for some type of data. In such cases the experimental analysis should be conducted on there types of inputs:
	- random: generated with pesudo-RNG
	- synthesized: prepared by the tester to expose possible errors and easy and hard cases
	- domain specific: data for the specific application for which the software is developed.

The cpp file is instrumented with chrono functions and additional counters.
THe measurements are tabulated in a file.
gnuplot is used to visualize the running time; alternativel Excel could be used.
