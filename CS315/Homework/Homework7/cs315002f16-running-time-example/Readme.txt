Compilation: use the command 'make' to generate the uva00567 and inputGenerator executables. The inputGenerator executable accepts an int parameter to generate input of size m for the uva00567 executable. After using 'chmod u+x experimentScript.sh', experimentScript.sh can be executed to generate experiment.dat.

Usage: Executing the experimentScript.sh creates the file experiment.dat, which contains 4 columns. These 4 columns, from left to right, indicate the input size m, the total running time of the algorithm, the amount of min operations, and the time/min operation, respectively.
Test cases are run for input sizes from 10 to 250 in increments of 10.

Notes: Homework7.docx contains my analysis for the homework assignment.
