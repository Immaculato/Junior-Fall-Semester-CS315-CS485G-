README for CS315-002 Final Project

Assignment: Final Project

Files included: Final_paper_cs315.docx, Final_presentation.pptx, README.txt, makefile, easyAsCabTopo.cpp, easyAsCabDFS.cpp, testanswerlarge, testinputlarge, testinputverylarge, testanswerverylarge

compilation:
Use the command `make` to make the easyAsCabDFS and easyAsCabTopo executables. The prior corresponds to the inefficient Depth-first search algorithm; the second, the topological sort adjacency matrix algorithm.

Use:
The testinputlarge and testinputverylarge files can be redirected as input to the easyAsCabDFS and easyAsCabTopo executables in order to see the differences in their runtimes (easyAsCabTopo is notably faster because of its better algorithm). testanswerlarge and testanswerverylarge correspond to the answers; theanswers for both exectuables should match these exactly.

Known bugs: none

Notes:
I do not take credit for the easyAsCABTopo.cpp source; this was borrowed from the ACM Mid-Centra 2016 solution set, and credit is given to the judge who authored this particular solution.
