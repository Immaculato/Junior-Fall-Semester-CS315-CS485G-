problem and its complexity

O(n^p) can get ugly fast

problem:
   instance: a1, ..., an, < R
   question: what is the max element in {a, ..., an}

upper bound: n-1
lower bound: based on computing model: n-1

Approximation algorithms are used to drastically reduce the running time of more compilicated algorithms by making a few guesses, and making a less accurate solution. ****
