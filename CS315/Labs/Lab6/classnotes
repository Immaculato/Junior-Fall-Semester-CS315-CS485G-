Union Find ----------
Uses set partitions (groups of elements).

3 operations:
	makeset( . )
	find( . )  -->  finds the set containing this element. Usually there is a representative of the set, which is 1 designated element in it.
	union( . , . ) --> returns a set containing both of the provided sets.

should always attach smaller tree to larger.

path compression: attaching all graph eleents to the node.

path compression pseudocode:

function Find(x) {
	if (x.parent != x) {
		x.parent = Find(x.parent);
	}
	return x.parent;
}
