what is the minimal number of coins to make change for n dollars with given
 denominations?

ex. denominations: 1 5 10 25

Does the greedy method: "use the biggest possible denominations" always work?
ex denomintaions: 1 5 10 12 25 50
Greedy algorithm returns 5 coins for n = 29. Is it optimal?
answer: not particularly. you could do 12, 12, and 5 to optimize to 3 coins.
	so the greedy method doesn't always work.

Formula:
ch(n) = change


ch(n)df = min # coins to change
	{ 0			   if n=0
ch(n) = { 
	{ min(i:d_i<=n){ch(n-x)+1} otherwise
