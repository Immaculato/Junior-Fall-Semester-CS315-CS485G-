we have n steps, meaning we climb n times.
each step burns 15 calories.
you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.

note: if you take 1 step, you are left with n-1 steps.
similarly, if you take a double step, you are left with n-2 steps.

how many ways can you lose 15n calories climbing n steps?

Hint: Think recursively!
